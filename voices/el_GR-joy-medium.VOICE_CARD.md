## About the Voice

JOY is a high-quality Greek Piper TTS voice trained entirely on human recordings by a native Greek speaker with formal academic training in linguistics and philology. It was created to fill the gap in open-source Greek TTS — all existing community voices were trained on synthetic or low-quality data, resulting in robotic, mispronounced output unsuitable for educational or assistive applications.

JOY is designed for:
- Educational software (Gemma4Kids)
- Greek-language assistants and chatbots
- Accessibility tools
- Any application requiring natural-sounding Greek TTS
